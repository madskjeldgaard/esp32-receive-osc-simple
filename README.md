# esp32-receive-osc-simple 
A simple example of receiving OSC messages on the ESP32 microcontroller. 

It uses [CNMAT's OSC library](https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC).

The project is set up as a [platformio](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/) project to make it easy to use.

At the root of the project is also a supercollider file with example code for controlling the esp32.
